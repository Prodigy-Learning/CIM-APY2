**Python Semantic Errors**

Semantic errors can be very difficult to find and are the result of a logic error in your code.

Semantic errors usually do not stop your program from running but usually result in your program not functioning as you expect to.

This could be for example:
- Looping around a loop one to many times
- Setting the value of a variable incorrectly
- The logic of a boolean condition being mixed up
- Improper indentation resulting in a line of code not being in an if statement or loop
